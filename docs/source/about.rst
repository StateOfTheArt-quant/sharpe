*sharpe* derived from our initial project `trading_gym <https://github.com/StateOfTheArt-quant/trading_gym>`_, which now is a event-driven(or observer) design pattern, the code highly inspired by `RQALPHA <https://github.com/ricequant/rqalpha>`_ 

This library is named *sharpe* to respect `William F. Sharpe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Sharpe>`_
